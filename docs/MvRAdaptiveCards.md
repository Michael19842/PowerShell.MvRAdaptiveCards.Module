# MvRAdaptiveCards Module
## Description
The MvRAdaptiveCards module provides PowerShell functions for creating, manipulating, and deploying Microsoft Adaptive Cards. Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI that can be used in various applications like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and other supported platforms.

This module offers a comprehensive set of functions for building interactive cards with elements like text blocks, images, tables, containers, and action sets. It also includes advanced templating capabilities for creating reusable card templates with dynamic content replacement, and integration with the online Adaptive Cards Designer for visual testing and development.
